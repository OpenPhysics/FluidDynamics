# Fluid Dynamics

[![CI](https://github.com/OpenPhysics/FluidDynamics/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/OpenPhysics/FluidDynamics/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Flow past an obstacle, from smooth laminar streamlines to a Kármán vortex
street to a turbulent wake — solved in real time on the GPU.

Built with [SceneryStack](https://scenerystack.org/), Vite 8, TypeScript 7 and
Biome 2.

Dye is injected in bands at the left edge of a channel and carried past a body in
the middle. Raising the flow speed (or lowering the viscosity) raises the
Reynolds number, and the wake changes character: attached and symmetric below
Re ≈ 47, shedding a periodic train of alternating vortices above it, and losing
coherence entirely by Re ≈ 200. The Reynolds number and the regime it implies are
shown beneath the field.

- **Intro** — a fixed cylinder and one control: flow speed.
- **Lab** — viscosity, obstacle size, shape (cylinder, flat plate, airfoil) and
  position, and four views of the field (dye, speed, vorticity, pressure).
  Vortex detail, dye fade and grid resolution live in Preferences → Simulation.
  Drag anywhere in the channel to push the fluid and add dye.

**WebGPU required.** The solver is Jos Stam's *Stable Fluids* running entirely in
WGSL compute shaders — there is no CPU fallback. Recent Chrome, Edge and Safari
support it. Where it is unavailable the sim boots normally and shows a message in
place of the field.

See [`doc/model.md`](doc/model.md) for the physics and its limits, and
[`doc/implementation-notes.md`](doc/implementation-notes.md) for the architecture.

## Features

- Stable Fluids solver in WGSL compute shaders (MacCormack advection, implicit
  viscous diffusion, vorticity confinement, red-black SOR pressure projection)
- Analytic signed-distance obstacles, so the body can be dragged and resized with
  no GPU resource churn
- Live accessible description of the flow, shared by the field and the screen
  summaries
- English, Spanish, and French localization via `StringManager`
- Default and projector color profiles
- Progressive Web App (installable, offline-capable)
- Git hooks for Biome pre-commit checks
- Shared GitHub Actions CI via `OpenPhysics/Baton`
