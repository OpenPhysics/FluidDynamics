 * Model for the Intro screen: flow past a cylinder the learner can move and
 * resize, with flow speed as the only panel control.
 *
 * The Intro screen exists to make one relationship visible — raise the flow
 * speed and the wake goes from smooth, to a periodic Kármán vortex street, to
 * turbulent. Everything that would dilute that (viscosity, obstacle shape,
 * visualization mode) is left at its default here and exposed on the Lab
 * screen instead. They are still real Properties on the shared FluidModel,
 * so the view and the solver treat both screens identically.
