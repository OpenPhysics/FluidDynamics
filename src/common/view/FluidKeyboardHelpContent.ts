/**
 * FluidKeyboardHelpContent.ts
 *
 * Content for the keyboard-help dialog (the "?" button in the navigation bar),
 * shared by both screens.
 *
 * Which sections appear is an option rather than a subclass, mirroring
 * FluidControlPanel: the two screens run the same interactions and differ only
 * in how many of them are exposed. The Intro screen has one slider and no combo
 * box, and its obstacle is a cylinder — which has no chord to tilt, no foci to
 * pull and no thickness — so it documents resizing alone.
 *
 * ── Where the rows come from ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The obstacle rows are built with KeyboardHelpSectionRow.fromHotkeyData from
 * the same HotkeyData the handles' listeners are built from (see
 * ObstacleHandleKeyboard.ts). The keys shown here are therefore the keys the sim
 * actually responds to, by construction — the icons are generated from the key
 * strings rather than drawn by hand.
 *
 * The remaining sections are the standard scenery-phet ones. They already
 * describe the sliders, combo boxes, draggable tools and time controls in the
 * fleet's shared vocabulary, so there is nothing sim-specific to say about them.
