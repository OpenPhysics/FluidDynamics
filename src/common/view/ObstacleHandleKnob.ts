/**
 * ObstacleHandleKnob.ts
 *
 * The visible grip shared by the obstacle's handles.
 *
 * The body is drawn by the display shader (see ObstacleHandleNode for why
 * Scenery never draws it), so a handle can only mark itself: a small dot with
 * a dark rim so it reads on both the dark body and the bright dye field. The
 * dot is deliberately tiny — it sits on the body's outline and must not cover
 * flow the learner is looking at — so the hit area is an invisible larger
 * circle around it, which is also the focusable node carrying the keyboard
 * interaction.
 *
 * That hit circle is as large as it can be without the knobs colliding: the
 * foci sit on top of each other at zero eccentricity, and the thickness knob
 * rides close to the leading edge on a slim airfoil. Touch needs more than
 * that, so the touch area is dilated past the visible geometry instead — a
 * finger gets a comfortable target without the mouse gaining one that overlaps
 * its neighbour.
