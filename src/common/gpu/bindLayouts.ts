/**
 * bindLayouts.ts
 *
 * The bind group layouts the solver's pipelines are built from, as plain data.
 *
 * WebGPU checks a bind *group* against its layout, and a shader's declared
 * resources against the pipeline layout — but only for resources the entry point
 * statically uses, and only at pipeline-creation time, on a device. That is a
 * long way from the code being edited: adding a binding to a kernel and
 * forgetting to add it to the layout it shares with five other kernels produces
 * a validation error at startup, on hardware, and nothing at all in the type
 * checker.
 *
 * So the layouts live here as data rather than as `device.createBindGroupLayout`
 * calls buried in the engine, and `tests/ShaderBindings.test.ts` parses the WGSL
 * to check that every `@group(0) @binding(n)` a shader declares exists in the
 * layout its pipelines use, with a compatible kind and storage format. That test
 * runs in Vitest with no GPU.
 *
 * Several kernels share a layout, and a layout may legitimately carry entries a
 * given kernel does not use — the obstacle field is bound to every compute
 * layout, but the dye injection kernel has no use for it. The check is therefore
 * one-directional: shader ⊆ layout.
