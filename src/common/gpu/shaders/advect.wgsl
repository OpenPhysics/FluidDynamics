// advect.wgsl — semi-Lagrangian transport with a MacCormack corrector.
//
// Step 1 of Stam's Stable Fluids: instead of pushing quantities forward (which
// goes unstable above a CFL of 1), trace each cell's position *backwards* along
// the velocity field and take whatever was there. Unconditionally stable at any
// timestep, at the cost of being diffusive.
//
// Two things are done about that cost, and both apply to the velocity field and
// to the dye:
//
//  1. The trace itself is a midpoint (RK2) step rather than a single Euler step.
//     An Euler trace follows the velocity at the arrival point for the whole
//     step, which cuts the corner on every curved path — and a vortex is nothing
//     but curved paths. Sampling the velocity once more at the halfway point
//     makes the trace second order in Δt for the cost of one extra fetch, and
//     the vortices of the Kármán street stop drifting toward their own centres.
//
//  2. The plain backward trace behaves like an extra viscosity of order h·|u|/2
//     — enough to smear the shear layer off the obstacle and wash the dye bands
//     out well before they reach the far end of the channel. So both fields are
//     advected with a MacCormack predictor–corrector (Selle, Fedkiw, Lanson,
//     Molemaker & Bridson, 2008): the predictor's backward step is corrected by
//     an anti-diffusive term built from a forward step, cancelling most of the
//     numerical diffusion. A bound-preserving limiter clamps the result to the
//     predictor's local range, so the correction cannot create new extrema —
//     which for the dye also means it can neither go negative nor invent a
//     colour that was not already in the neighbourhood.
//
// The bilinear filtering in textureSampleLevel is what makes the trace second
// order in space; it is also why the velocity and dye textures are rgba16float
// (filterable) rather than rg32float (not, without an optional feature).
//
