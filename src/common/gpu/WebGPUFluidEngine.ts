/**
 * WebGPUFluidEngine.ts
 *
 * Jos Stam's Stable Fluids, run entirely in WGSL compute shaders.
 *
 * The engine owns every GPU resource and the whole fluid state; nothing is
 * mirrored on the CPU. Its only inputs are the parameter values handed to
 * {@link step} each frame, and its only output is the detached canvas it renders
 * into, which FluidFieldNode blits into Scenery.
 *
 * ── One frame ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   [bake obstacle mask, if it moved] → advect velocity (MacCormack: predict →
 *   correct) → diffuse (viscosity, red-black SOR ×N) → curl → vorticity
 *   confinement → forces & boundaries → divergence → pressure (red-black SOR ×N)
 *   → subtract pressure gradient → inject dye → advect dye (MacCormack) →
 *   [advect tracer dots, if shown] → display [→ draw tracer dots]
 *
 * Every compute dispatch above is recorded into a single compute pass on a
 * single command encoder, with one queue submission per frame.
 *
 * A paused frame identical to the one before it skips the whole compute pass and
 * records only the display — see the idle guard in step().
 *
 * Two of those counts are not fixed. The pressure sweeps come from the learner's
 * accuracy preference. The diffusion sweeps are derived per step from the
 * stiffness of the viscous solve — see common/gpu/solverSchedule.ts — which both
 * cuts the count at the cheap end of the viscosity range and raises it where a
 * fixed count used to leave the fluid less viscous than the readout claimed.
 *
 * ── Ping-pong ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A shader cannot read and write the same texture, so velocity, dye and pressure
 * each exist twice and swap roles after every write. Bind groups reference
 * concrete texture views, so every combination of parities that the frame can
 * reach is built once at construction: allocating bind groups inside the frame
 * loop is the classic way to make a WebGPU renderer allocate 60 times a second.
 *
 * ── The obstacle mask ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The solver asks whether a cell is solid several times per cell in nearly every
 * dispatch. Answering it analytically means re-evaluating the obstacle SDF —
 * transcendentals, for the airfoil — tens of millions of times a frame for an
 * answer that only changes when the learner moves the body. So it is baked into
 * a texture by mask.wgsl and re-baked only when the obstacle or the grid
 * changes.
 *
 * ── Texture formats ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Velocity and dye are rgba16float because semi-Lagrangian advection wants
 * hardware bilinear filtering, and rgba16float is both filterable and usable as
 * a storage texture in core WebGPU. rg32float would fit velocity exactly but is
 * not filterable without an optional feature. Pressure, divergence and curl are
 * r32float and are only ever read with textureLoad, so filtering does not apply.
