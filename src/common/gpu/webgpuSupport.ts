/**
 * webgpuSupport.ts
 *
 * Feature detection and device acquisition for the WebGPU fluid solver.
 *
 * WebGPU is only available in recent browsers, and even there an adapter can be
 * refused (no compatible GPU, blocklisted driver, headless CI). Every caller
 * therefore gets a discriminated result rather than a throwing API, and the
 * simulation degrades to a "not supported" message instead of failing to boot.
 *
 * ── One device, many screens ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A GPUDevice is expensive and shareable: GPU resources created from it can be
 * used by any number of canvases. Both the Intro and Lab screens therefore await
 * the SAME cached promise; only per-screen resources (textures, canvas contexts)
 * are duplicated.
 *
 * ── Why no console output ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `noConsole` is an error inside src/, and a console message would be invisible
 * to the learner anyway. Failures are reported as a `GpuUnavailableReason` code,
 * which the view maps to a localized string.
