 *
 * How hard the iterative solves have to work this step.
 *
 * Both the viscous diffusion solve and the pressure solve are stationary
 * iterations, and both have a well-known optimal over-relaxation factor. Rather
 * than pinning a sweep count and a relaxation factor to whatever looked right at
 * one grid resolution, these functions derive them from the problem the solver
 * has actually been handed.
 *
 * ── Why this matters for the diffusion solve ──────────────────────────────────
 * The implicit viscous solve is (I − νΔt∇²)u = u₀, whose stiffness is the single
 * number α = νΔt/h². A plain Jacobi sweep reduces the error by at most
 * ρ_J = 4α/(1 + 4α) per sweep, and α grows with the *square* of the resolution:
 * at ν = 10⁻³ m²/s and Δt = 1/60 s it is 0.27 on the 256 × 128 grid but 17 on the
 * 2048 × 1024 one. Twelve Jacobi sweeps leave 0.8 % of the error at the first and
 * 84 % of it at the second — so at the fine resolutions the fluid was quietly
 * less viscous than the learner asked for, in the direction that inflates the
 * effective Reynolds number.
 *
 * Red-black SOR with the optimal factor for that α converges at ω − 1 per sweep
 * instead, which is 0.08 and 0.71 for the same two cases. The sweep count then
 * follows from the accuracy actually wanted, so the cheap end of the range gets
 * cheaper and the stiff end gets correct.
 *
 * No GPU or scenery dependency: this is arithmetic, and it is unit-tested.

 * The Jacobi iteration matrix of (1 + 4α)x_c − αΣx_n = f has spectral radius
