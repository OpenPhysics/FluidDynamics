 * shaders/common.wgsl. The numeric codes below are what gets written into the
 * `obstacleShape` uniform, so they must agree with the branch that function
 * takes on it.
 *
 * (The SDF is baked into a mask texture by mask.wgsl when the body moves rather
 * than being re-evaluated per cell per kernel; see the notes in
 * WebGPUFluidEngine.ts. The codes are the contract either way.)
 *
 * `erasableSyntaxOnly` rules out a TS enum, so this is an as-const union.
