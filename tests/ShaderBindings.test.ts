/**
 * Tests for the WGSL/bind-group-layout contract.
 *
 * A compute kernel's resources are checked against its pipeline layout by
 * WebGPU, but only at pipeline-creation time and only on a real device — which
 * in this sim means "the whole field turns into the WebGPU-unavailable message,
 * on hardware, with a validation error in the console". Since several kernels
 * share a layout, adding a binding to one of them and forgetting the layout is
 * an easy mistake with a very indirect symptom.
 *
 * So the layouts are declared as plain data in bindLayouts.ts and these tests
 * parse the shader sources to check that every binding a kernel declares exists
 * in the layout its pipelines are built with, with a compatible kind and, for
 * storage textures, the same format. No GPU required.
 *
 * The check is one-directional — shader ⊆ layout — because a shared layout may
 * legitimately carry entries a given kernel has no use for. The obstacle field
 * is bound to every compute layout, but the dye injection kernel never asks
 * where the body is.
