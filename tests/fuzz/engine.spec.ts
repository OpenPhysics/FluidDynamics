/**
 * Engine integration test — does the solver actually behave like a fluid?
 *
 * The whole fluid state lives in GPU textures, so none of it is reachable from
 * Vitest. This test drives the real engine in a real browser through
 * tests/harness/engine.html (served and transpiled by the Vite dev server), runs
 * actual compute passes, and reads the rendered frame back with
 * WebGPUFluidEngine.readDisplayPixels().
 *
 * ── Requirements ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A WebGPU adapter. Chromium needs `--enable-unsafe-webgpu --enable-features=Vulkan`
 * on Linux; playwright.config.ts passes them. Where no adapter is available the
 * tests skip rather than fail, since that is also the configuration in which the
 * sim correctly shows its "WebGPU is not available" message.
 *
 * Presentation is disabled in the harness: some headless environments lose the
 * device the moment a WebGPU canvas is presented, while compute and offscreen
 * rendering work correctly.
